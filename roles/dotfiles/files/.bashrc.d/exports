# Bash eternal history
# --------------------
#
# From: https://github.com/startup-class/dotfiles/blob/master/.bashrc
#
# This snippet allows infinite recording of every command you've ever
# entered on the machine, without using a large HISTFILESIZE variable,
# and keeps track if you have multiple screens and ssh sessions into the
# same machine. It is adapted from:
# http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/543.
#
# The way it works is that after each command is executed and
# before a prompt is displayed, a line with the last command (and
# some metadata) is appended to ~/.bash_eternal_history.
#
# This file is a tab-delimited, timestamped file, with the following
# columns:
#
# 1) user
# 2) hostname
# 3) screen window (in case you are using GNU screen)
# 4) date/time
# 5) current working directory (to see where a command was executed)
# 6) the last command you executed
#
# The only minor bug: if you include a literal newline or tab (e.g. with
# awk -F"\t"), then that will be included verbatime. It is possible to
# define a bash function which escapes the string before writing it; if you
# have a fix for that which doesn't slow the command down, please submit
# a patch or pull request.
