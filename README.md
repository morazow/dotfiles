# ~/dotfiles
[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/morazow/dotfiles.svg?style=flat-square)][travis]

A collection of configuration files for `m.orazow`.

Currently I am developing in OS X. However, there are files for Linux OS also. I try to keep both
environments up-to-date and synchronized.

## Quick Start

Git clone this repository and then run `./run`.
